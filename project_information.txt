    X Delete
X Record CRUD
    X Create

* Jasmine-Karma
    // All controllers and services need a test
    // All controller tests should mock the DOM elements and services
    // All CRUD operations need a test
    // Test submit method
    X Create
        X should create prepopulation on init
        X should create a new person
        - should push to list tab containing all guests upon creation
            // ng-repeat to registerCache
    X Retrieve
        X should retrieve a person by key
        - should retrieve only guests not marked as deleted
            // records will be hidden in the view based on the value of the deleted field
    X Update
        X should update fname
        X should update lname
        - should update txdate
            // dates are too hard to test with such a fast framework, and coded delays smell funny.
        X should update loc
        X should update status from 'pick-up' to 'arrived'
        X should update status from 'drop off' to 'arrived'
        X should update status 'arrived' to 'pick up'
            X add topography
        X should not update id
    X Delete
        X should delete as a 'soft' delete with flag
        X should return only active (deleted:false) records
X View
    X Tab 1: Record
        X Create
        X Retrieve (display)
            X create model binding
                X Controller
                X model
                X ng-model -> person cache
            X Display updates as updates are made
                    X Add {{}} hooks to each form element
    > Tab 2: Register
        X List Display
            X ng-repeat used to run through the data
            > update status inline per status map
                * "pick up" to "arrived"
                * "drop off" to "arrived"

* Spec
    * README.md contents
        * build instructions
        * everything someone needs to know to get it running from scratch
    * Requirements and Restrictions
        * Do not use $scope or $rootScope to pass variables; only invoke native Angular methods
